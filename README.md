# Catalyst

This repository features two main projects:

* Catalyst: A thin but opinionated abstraction layer to write Vulkan Code in C# (using Silk.NET) with fewer boilerplate code.
* Catalyst.Engine: A small proof of concept application engine using Vulkan and ImGUI

See the sample apps for details :)
